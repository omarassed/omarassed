- 👋 Hi, I’m @omarassed, welcome to my GitHub!
- 👨‍💻 I’m a software engineer with 4 years of experience building full-stack applications using React, Ruby on Rails, though I currently specialize in the MERN stack.
- 🧠 I’m currently diving deep into AI/ML, large language models (LLMs), and how to build real-world applications powered by AI agents.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving AI integration, LLM workflows, and smart full-stack apps that push the boundaries of automation and intelligence.
- 📫 How to reach me ... via email omar.assed@gmail.com or just here on GitHub
