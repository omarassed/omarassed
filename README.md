Hi, I’m @omarassed — welcome to my GitHub!
👨‍💻 I’m a software engineer and recent T-Mobile Software Engineering Intern with hands-on experience building full-stack applications using Java (Spring Boot), React, Node.js, and the MERN stack.
⚙️ I’ve worked across the full software development lifecycle — designing UIs, building APIs, integrating databases, writing tests, and deploying to cloud environments (AWS).
📊 Recently, I built production-grade systems including a real-time metrics dashboard, REST API integrations, and microservices for automating data workflows.
🤖 I'm currently exploring applied AI, LLM-powered developer tools, and how to integrate agentic AI into real-world web applications.
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on full-stack, cloud, or AI-driven projects.
