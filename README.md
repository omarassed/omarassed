👋 Hi, I’m @omarassed, welcome to my GitHub!
👨‍💻 I’m a software engineer with 4 years of experience building full-stack applications using React, Ruby on Rails, who specializes in the MERN stack with a deep interest in AI integration into full stack applications.
🧠 I’m currently diving deep into AI/ML, large language models (LLMs), and how to build real-world applications powered by AI agents.
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving AI integration, LLM workflows, and smart full-stack apps that push the boundaries of automation and intelligence.
